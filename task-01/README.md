## Task 01:
I am not that much of a fan of Harry Potter. So I am new to this task. This task was a little tricky to find the answer.

## Approaching Task-01
- This is easy to find the spells. I found the smallest perfect number is 6, and I did differentiation. That helped me find the ".txt" file.
- I found the first element used in semiconductors. That helped me to find the spells file, and I executed it. Finally, I found the flag.
- Here the tricky part is using git and Linux. But I attended Hacktober. I got some familiar with git on that day, so I somehow managed GitHub. I used to watch GitHub Tutorials from Freecodecamp and some web sources that helped me gain knowledge in GitHub and its commands.
- I found the Terminal wizard repo and found the spells file > Executed it > Successfully Found the flag.
- I enjoyed the last part where I decoded the base64 and found the URL. When I went through the link I found the GitHub Repo. I cloned it on my device. I found CONGRATULATIONS. I got very happy after seeing that. That also motivates me to do further tasks.

## From this task, I learned a lot of Git cmds and Linux cmds
### Git cmds
- `git push`
- `git add`
- `git commit -m "Some msg"`
- `git pull`
- `git checkout` (branch)
- `git log`
- `git clone "url"`

### Linux Terminal cmds
- `cd` (dir name)
- `mkdir` (dir name)
- `touch` (file.name)
- `cat` (file.name)
- `pwd`
- `mv` (src path)(destination path)
- `rm` (File)
- `cp` (src_path)(destination_path)
- `echo -n (base64string) | base64 -d`
- `exit`
