## WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEEDBACK ON THE PRAVESHAN SELECTION PROCESS?
Participating in the Praveshan selection process proved to be an exhilarating journey filled with both enjoyment and challenges. Stepping out of my comfort zone, I encountered hurdles that tested my abilities and pushed me to new limits. Amidst these trials, the presence of my mentor, Kshitij Thareja, was like a beacon of light, guiding me through the maze of uncertainties. His unwavering support and insightful guidance proved invaluable, offering me the strength and direction needed to navigate the complexities of the tasks.

The Praveshan selection process has been a profound learning experience for me, teaching me the importance of starting early in life. As I navigated through the tasks and challenges, I realized that procrastination only hampers progress and adds unnecessary pressure. By witnessing the benefits of early preparation and dedication, I've come to understand that laying a strong foundation early on sets the stage for future success.
