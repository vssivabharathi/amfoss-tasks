# How I approach the problem ;

First I understand the question and I wrote my mathematical approach to the problem. After finding the way to approach the problem , I started to covent my idea to code . Initial i did in PYTHON language. Beacause it has easy syntax. I used w3school to learn language.

After completing the task_03 problem in python , It became bit easy beacuse its just translating to other languages by understanding the logical and syntax. Still working on different language is a new experience.
