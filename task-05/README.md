This task is easy one, because after completing my class 12th I went to computer class where I learned the WEB development. I have some knowledge on 
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
and I also worked on some frameworks like 
- Bootstrap
- Django
 
## Approach To this task
I kept that image and i made a skelton of the webpage just using the HTML and I used the w3school for CSS because I am not that much good in remembering everything I also used the javascript in this website "Imagine Dragons". I hope it will similar to that image which you guys gave me in the task.
